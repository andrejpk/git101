# Git 101 for Hackathons

This guide is a basic overview of using Git, focusing on a Hackathon scenario where a team of developers and business users are working on a project together and pushing code into a PaaS platform (e.g. Azure) or a documentation system that uses Git to upload content/code. 

We don't assume any prior exposure to source control but do assume the user understands basic command prompt use. The examples are built on Windows but will work similarly on Mac and Linux command-lines.
