# Setting up your environment

You'll probably need the Git tools installed locally to work with a Git repo. (Although some development tools have Git directly integrated.) For this tutorial, we will use the command line Git tools because they are available broadly across many platforms work the same way everywhere. 

If you prefer to use integrated Git support in your development tool of choice, that's great. The same concepts still apply but the process you'll use will be different depending on the tool. We still recommend installing these tools so you can follow along here and troubleshoot problems if your development tool doesn't work as expected. 

## Installing Git
We'll be using the standard Git distribution. 
- Go to the (Git download page)[https://git-scm.com/download] and download the correct package for your platform (PC/Mac/Linux).
- Run the installer with the default options checked. You may need to have administrator rights on your computer to complete the install.
